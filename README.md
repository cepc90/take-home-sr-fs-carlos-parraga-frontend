#### How to run

To run this application you have to execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

Go to localhost:3000 on your browser and you should see the application running.

Please note, the backend must also be running or you will not be able to do anything with the app.

The backend can be found at: https://github.com/cepc90/TakeHomeSrFsCarlosParraga with instructions on how to run it. It has cors disabled for easier testing.

The node version that I used v18.15.0 and the npm version 9.6.4.
